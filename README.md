Simple Auto suggest to use
This is simple tool whic has been done using simple textbox element. you can use it for 
understanding the autoasuggest functionality

we need to provide three argument as param for autosuggest.

<AutoSuggest 
	onSuggestionsValue={this.onSuggestionsValue}
	getvalue={this.getvalue} 
	data={this.state.data}/>

for Testing I have created AutoSuggestTest file using that you can test.
